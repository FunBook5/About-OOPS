     // Encapsulation means wrapping up all implementation in a class
     //NOTE: implemented by getter setter and access modifiers.

    // Abstraction means hiding the unnecessary details and only showing the essential information.
    // NOTE: implemented by using Abstract keyword and interfaces in java.

    //Example - Taking money out of ATM
       //     - Starting of a car with only a key not worrying about what is happening inside.


    // In one line abstraction is solving a design level issue, encapsulation is solving a implementation level issue.
    // Another one liner --  Abstraction is a process of gaining information and encap is the process of containing info.
